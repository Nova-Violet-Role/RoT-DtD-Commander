## 1.0.0 (2026-09-02)

First public release.

- 58 commands, 18 skills and 4 agents, each carrying a DOCTYPE: an answer
  grammar, a verdict vocabulary, numbered laws and a trust boundary
  (`rdc list`).
- Four shared subsets under `dtd/`: `cc-core`, `cc-ask`, `cc-report`,
  `cc-record`; inlined into every file by `rdc build` with a two-pass
  parameter-entity resolver (`rdc build`: 210 targets written).
- The checker, rules C1 to C12, on every source in both directions
  (`rdc check --xml`: checked 80, failed 0, xml-run 6, xml-invalid 0).
- Six grammars validated against example instances with `xmlstarlet`
  (`examples/`); a broken instance rejected with a named error before the
  valid one is trusted (`checker/checker-controls.sh`).
- The Adiutor: hooks on ten events, a ledger under a numbered append-only
  record, a `/RoT-DtD-Commander-Adiutor` doctor, policy `off|warn|strict`
  bound to the code default; eight controls (`node bin/adiutor.mjs controls`:
  8 run, 0 failing).
- The guided NPX installer with a manifest, a verified byte-level re-read and
  a reversible arm of the hooks.
- Twenty new commands drawn from the Phantom Books shelf, four power-ups with
  the AskUserQuestion grammar, seven new skills, four auditor agents.
- SPDX headers in every source file (`checker/spdx-sweep.sh`: 244 checked,
  0 missing); no carriage returns anywhere (`checker/crlf-sweep.sh`).
- Licence: AGPL-3.0-or-later OR EUPL-1.2, with MIT portions from
  taches-cc-resources declared in `NOTICE.md`.
